# hca-ebi-wrangler-central

This repo is for tracking work related to wrangling datasets for the HCA, associated tasks and for maintaining related documentation. 


## Introduction
The goal of the hca-ebi-data-wrangling repository is to track datasets for the HCA and other tasks related to wrangling process to maintain consistent data flow. **This is a public repo and should not contain any sensitive or personal information about groups contributing data to the HCA.**


## Repo structure

The [`docs/`](https://github.com/ebi-ait/hca-ebi-wrangler-central/tree/master/docs) folder contains a collection of documents not directly related to a particular dataset but otherwise useful for the wrangler process including:

- [SOP documents](https://github.com/ebi-ait/hca-ebi-wrangler-central/tree/master/docs/SOPs)
- [EBI wrangler onboarding document](https://github.com/ebi-ait/hca-ebi-wrangler-central/tree/master/docs/ebi-wrangler-onboarding.md)

## Repo implementation

Any document in this repo can be updated at any time by committing and pushing changes directly to the master branch. Please be specific with commit statements. If an update to a document addresses an open GitHub issue, you can tag the issue in the commit statement by using Fixes #000 and replacing 000 with the number of the issue. 

If you are making changes that you would like to be reviewed by someone, make a branch off of master and name it with your initials and a brief description of the change.Then make a PR against the master branch, tag appropriate people for review, merge your own PR after approval, and delete the branch. **Merging one's own PRs is acceptable in this repo.**



### GitHub Milestones

A **Milestone** is made for a given period of time - for example for a "phase" or for a "sprint" - depending on what the priorities are for the wrangling team. The exact timing of each Milestone will be decided by the Product Owner with input from the wranglers.

Currently, EBI wrangler team uses Milestones only for the bi-weekly sprint cycles.

### GitHub Issues

An **Issue** (or task) is made for a particular set of tasks (each called a *subtask*) that a wrangler needs to complete. The granularity of subtasks can change depending on wrangler needs and project priorities. All the subtasks needed to be completed for an issue are listed as checked boxes in the issue description. There is a template issue to be used to make new issues for wrangler tasks. These issues will automatically be assigned the label "task".

### GitHub Labels

Various labels have been created to help wranglers track issues relating to certain topics and can be found here: [hca-ebi-wrangler-central/labels](https://github.com/ebi-ait/hca-ebi-wrangler-central/labels)
