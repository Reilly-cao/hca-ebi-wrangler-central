# Setup public OwnCloud folder

Sometimes to get smallish files from contributors the `hca-util` process is a bit heavy. Here is an alternate way to get a small number of smallish files from a contributor without them having to download and configure `hca-util`.

The standard storage amount for EBI's ownCloud service is 50gb, so if the files are bigger than that or you don't have enough storage this method is not suitable.

## Step-by-step

1. Login to your ebi ownCloud account with your ebi username and password -> [https://oc.ebi.ac.uk/login](https://oc.ebi.ac.uk/login)
1. Create a directory in your ownCloud 
1. follow the instructions in the [ownCloud link share docs](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/user_manual/files/public_link_shares.html#creating-public-link-shares)
