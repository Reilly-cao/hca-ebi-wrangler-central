# Request Ontology terms SOP

## Objectives
Outline the process of **requesting ontology terms**, as well as document release dates for the wrangler team.

### Requesting new ontology terms
Ontology requests should be issued as tickets on the [ontology repository](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/ontology). Please request them using the issue template provided in there and tag Zoe.

### Release dates and plan of release
The tickets added to the ontology repository, as posted above, are revised by @zoependlington after tagging. Depending on your request:

- **New term request**: Terms should be requested by the 12th of each month*.
- **Import of terms from other ontologies into HCAO**: Up until the 17th of each month.

*New terms might not be available after each monthly release if requesting to an external database (Not EFO).

Release of databases:
- EFO = ~16th of each month.
- HCAO = ~18-19th of each month.

Once Zoe updates the HCAO it gets automatically released to the [EBI OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/hcao). She will usually ping the ingest team to also release the ontology to our environments on:
- [Staging](https://ontology.staging.archive.data.humancellatlas.org/index)
- [Production](https://ontology.archive.data.humancellatlas.org/index)

### Ontology-related questions
For any question, please contact @zoependlington. She is also available on the HCA `data-wrangling-int` slack channel. Please use tickets for complex ontology questions.

Please take in account that she is only working 20% for the HCA, so be patient with your requests.
