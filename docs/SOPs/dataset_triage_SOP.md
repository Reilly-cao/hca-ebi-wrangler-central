# Dataset Triage SOP

## Dataset Prioritisation

### Numbering system for prioritisation
The prioritisation of datasets in the ‘HCA priority’ column of the tracker sheet should be indicated on a scale from 0 - 8, so that highest priority dataset rows can be easily sorted to the top of the tracker sheet and low priority and complete dataset rows at bottom of the sheet. The following number system should be used when assigning datasets with a particular priority level.

**0: in-progress datasets**

Here, in-progress is defined as any state after acknowledgment and before completion. Completion here is defined as a dataset which has been validated in ingest and is in the ‘archiving’ state, or has been submitted to DCP1.0 or DCP2.0. NOTE: this should also include new contributor’s data; since they are always top priority, they should be started and in-progress very soon if not immediately as we hear about them. This should include datasets which have been stalled; in that case please indicate that they are ‘blocked’ in the ‘HCA status’ column and if possible, a note explaining why in the ‘HCA status comment’ column.

**1: Human, primary, normal samples**

**2: Human, primary, disease samples**

**3: Low passage human-derived cultures, organoids or iPSCs**

**4: All Mouse datasets excluding 2D and/or immortalised cell lines**

**5: All 2D cell line and/or immortalised cell lines**

**6: The dataset requires discussion**

A dataset may need discussion for various reasons before assigning a priority. For example, it may include a mixture of organisms, technologies and health statuses, or it might include a transgenic or xenograft model that we are not sure is supported.

**7: Unsupported datasets**

This should indicate that a dataset is unsupported by the HCA processing pipelines, or unsupported by our current metadata schema, for example, a xenograft model.

**8: Complete datasets**

Completion here is defined as a dataset which has been validated in ingest and is in the ‘archiving’ state, or has been submitted to DCP1.0 or DCP2.0.


### Adding prioritisation comments

Other than the numbering system, comments should be entered in the ‘External Prioritisation’ column and ‘Prioritisation Discussion’ columns if/when appropriate. It is important to add a comment in the ‘Prioritisation Discussion’ column if you have prioritised a dataset with level 6 (the dataset requires discussion).

### External Prioritisation

Notes supporting particular high prioritisation of a dataset. This can include a high cell count, rare cell types/tissues, HCA publication, funding source (CZI, WSSS, MRC) for example. It is intended to be flexible.

### Prioritisation Discussion

Please add a comment here if you have prioritised a dataset with level 6 (the dataset requires discussion). The comment should include a summary of what IS supported (metadata and pipelines). These datasets will then be discussed by the team on a regular basis.

### Prioritisation Discussion Meetings

A regular meeting will be set up for the team to meet and discuss datasets labelled as ‘6: the dataset requires discussion’. Each wrangler will be responsible for summarising the datasets that they had labelled this way for discussion in the meeting, and we will discuss them all between us. For now, I propose we set this up as a regular monthly meeting between the AIT HCA wranglers, Laura and Claire. We could adjust the time interval based on how this works out. This can be a never-ending task; we need to decide whether we set a certain number of datasets to be assessed (like 30) or do this task for a certain time (2 hours, for example). The idea is that this SOP document and potentially the tracker sheet will be updated based on feedback from these discussions.
