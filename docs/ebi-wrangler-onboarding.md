## Where to find general information

### About the EBI

The [EBI Intranet](https://tsc.ebi.ac.uk/) is a great resource and the search function is pretty good at finding relevant info. There is also a dedicated webpage for [newcomers](https://tsc.ebi.ac.uk/newcomers) with lots of useful information that you might not yet even know you need to know.

### EBI Human Cell Atlas team processes and procedures

Our main source for general info about our processes at the EBI branch of the HCA is the [confluence website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/HCA/Human+Cell+Atlas+Home), take all information found here with a grain of salt because much of it is outdated. You will need editing privileges to the wiki in order to fill out your [Weekly Activity Report](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=HCA&title=Weekly+Activity+Reports) so if you don't see an `edit` button at the top right of the page then ask @lauraclarke to give you the appropriate access. It is a good idea to have a brief look over the various pages that exist on confluence as you will most likely need to refer back to them later.

In particular take note of the following pages:
- [Holiday request and sick leave procedure](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/HCA/Holiday+requests%2C+working+from+home+and+sick+leave)
- [Work travel procedure](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/HCA/HCA+Travel+Procedure)
- [Timesheet policy](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/HCA/Timesheet+Guidance)

If anything isn’t clear, please ask Laura or Claire.

### About the Human Cell Atlas

The [HCA white paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05192) gives a great view of the ethos of the project but is light on specifics on what will be done.

### Feedback
This is a living document we want to make it better with every person that joins the team. If you have any ideas for improvement, for example if you can't find certain topics that you think should be here, please write them down and report back as to improve this documentation.

## General suggestions

### First day
- Send your github username to Laura so that you can get access to our git organisation
- Set up your computer. Do ask any of the wrangler team if you encounter any issues.
- Set up your favourite web browser. It will make more sense later, but the usual "go-to" for the wranglers is Google Chrome, as some of the tasks that you’re going to do require some plug-ins.
- *For Mac Users:* Look at the “Managed Software Centre” app thoroughly. Install every app you think you will need, asking for help when necessary.
- You should install:
  - **E-mail manager app**. People use either the default installed by your operating system or thunderbird, though any e-mail manager should be fine (Except for Gmail). Information about setting up your email for EBI users can be [found on the intranet](https://tsc.ebi.ac.uk/article/desktop/email/email-basics-0).
  - **Notes app**. You can use either google keep, Evernote (Pretty useful, and it’s on the recommended list), or your choice of preference.  Make sure you record every single thing that you do while working (Doesn’t have to be long, just a short a concise job description). It may seem like a major inconvenience at the beginning, but it will come in very handy when you have to fill your timesheets, especially if you have to dedicate percentages of time to different grants.
  - **[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/downloads/)**. It is highly recommended to set it up on your desktop rather than using the web app. It is optional whether you want to install the app on your phone. 
  - **[Bluejeans](https://www.bluejeans.com/downloads)**. You will use this for some teleconferences.
- Make sure you have all the necessary cables/adaptors to set up your mac with your monitor, with an appropriate keyboard and mouse. 
- Make sure you have access to:
  - SAP
  - [Confluence website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/HCA/Human+Cell+Atlas+Home)
  - E-mail
- Since your e-mail was probably created some weeks before your actual starting day, you will probably have 100+ e-mails. Most of them won’t have any interest to you (Mostly the older ones) but try to at least read the title before archiving/deleting them (And try to not delete any important e-mail. They should be archived, as they might be useful to revisit in the future)
- At reception, they will give you some documents to fill in.
- You will most likely have a meeting with your Human Resources (HR) officer where you will be provided with more forms and information. They will also guide you through your first steps. Don't hesitate to ask them, they are here to help.
- The bus timetables and routes can be found [here](https://helix.wtgc.org/content/bus-timetables).

### First week
- Make sure you check the calendar every day. There might be meetings you don’t want to miss. This is a general thing to do, but it will probably only take you a couple days to get used to.
- The first week, your PL (Project Leader) will guide you through several meetings. 
- General meetings you will have are:
  - Introductory meeting with the PL
  - Expectations meeting
  - Induction meeting(s) with HR and other teams. They will help you set up and give you guidelines about the documentation you need to fill in and send once you get here. Take good note, as there will be plenty!
  - Try to bookmark, at least, confluence, SAP, the calendar, the git repositories that you use the most and the intranet. It comes in very handy.
- Get used to git. Get ready to clone, pull, push, commit, and read the docs. We have really useful guides in there!

### Each day
- Keep a good record of what you are doing, how many hours and, in case you have more than one cost centre, try to prioritize 

### Each week:
- Fill in your timesheet (SAP)
- Fill in the WAR (Confluence) - each Monday for the previous week of work
<!--
## Specifics

### Calendar
You can either set it up on your favourite calendar app or use google calendar. Most of the wranglers use google calendar, but it’s your decision to make. Thunderbird has a nifty Google Calendar extension which might be of interest. Once set up, you will notice that the events represented inside have different colours which are customisable by you. The Calendars that you should have access to are:
- [**HCA google calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=ZWJpLmFjLnVrXzhzbm5la2c1b3Yxcm81ZW5vYXY2M3ZmbDZjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20): This is where anyone working on the HCA at EBI records events that may affect the EBI team (need to check this), they may or may not be relevant to wranglers. This calendar is managed by Oihane
- [**DCP Meeting calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YnJvYWRpbnN0aXR1dGUub3JnXzNrMWxzaW4wcGI0dXRnZzhkODdwbG5oY2M4QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20): This is where DCP-wide meetings are scheduled, not all meetings are relevant to wranglers. It includes meetings that could be across multiple sites UCSC/Broad/EBI/CZI/Stanford
- [**HCA-EBI BlueJeans Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1?cid=ZWJpLmFjLnVrXzl1NG1tdmFudmcxazBmNmNwOTVzMGlsZXZzQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20): This lets you know who is using the BlueJeans account when, more info [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/HCA/HCA+BlueJeans+account).
- [**AIT Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=ZWJpLmFjLnVrX2luOHQzc2IwZTRlbGtoc21xaGkyaXY4cDgwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20): This calendar is where the AIT team record AIT group meetings, vacation and sick leave, work from home (WFH) days and training.

If you can't see any of the above calendars, request access from Laura

If you need to create an event (e.g., to book a meeting with someone), you can left-click on the appropriate time (It goes by 30-minute periods), fill out the event details (title names should be short and concise, if you need to explain further details you can do so in the event description), and click on “more options” if you need to invite a guest.

You can view the calendar from other people of the team, unless they make it private. This is useful when planning meetings and trying to find a time that suits everyone.

#### Regular Meetings                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Key meetings that wranglers are summarised in the table below:

| Meeting                              | Day       | Time   | Frequency             | Notes                                |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Metadata community call              | Monday    | 4pm    | First monday Monthly  | Telecon                              |
| EBI wrangler Pre-sprint prioritisation & planning  | Monday    | 2pm    | Bi-weekly             | In-person                            |

| AIT Team meetings                    | Thursday  | 3pm    | Bi-weekly             | In person, alternates between dev and general interest |

#### DCP-wide Meetings

DCP-wide meetings are held bi-annually and involve collaborators from other sites, such as UCSC, Broad and CZI getting together in the same place and discussing various issues. They generally last 3 days and involve multiple streams on different topics. It is a good idea to find out when and where the next one is being held so you ensure you are available to go. Check out the DCP meeting calendar to see the next proposed dates.

#### HCA-wide Meetings

Scientific meetings are held a few times a year and are a great opportunity to connect directly with researchers involved in the HCA. However, the tickets for these events are limited so Wranglers aren't guaranteed a spot. Project leads do their best to advocate for Wranglers attending so check on whether you are likely to attend the next one.

### Slack

By this point you have probably already joined, but if not, join the `HumanCellAtlas` workspace. Since DCP2 was announced in April 2020, Slack is much less used than before. The main channels you should join and pay attention to are:

- `ebi-wrangler-metadata`: Private channel for the ebi based wrangler and metadata team
- `hca-metadata`: This is where general HCA metadata discussions happen.
- `hca-metadata-int`: integrated with the metadata-schema github repo, used mainly for discussions about updates to the repo

Feel free to browse other public channels within the workspace.

For AIT communication there is also an AIT workspace (embl-ebi-ait.slack.com) . Relevant channels to join in this workspace include:
- `hca`
- `hca-to-archives`

Social channels within AIT include:
- `games`, `social-events`, `tea-time` & `whatson`

There are also EBI-wide channels that will appear in your AIT workspace for institute-wide announcements

For all the private channels, you will need to request access. Ask any of us to help you through!

If you have a quick question and you or the wrangler you want to ask are unavailable at the moment, feel free to send them a message and they will answer whenever they are free/awake.

Take into account that you might need to join more/less channels than the ones listed here.


### SAP

For EMBL-EBI Wranglers

[SAP](https://saperp.embl.de/nwbc/?sap-client=100&sap-language=EN&sap-nwbc-node=root&sap-theme=SAP_CORBU) contains several important services, such as timesheets, leave records and some other useful administration requests. Your access to SAP might not be immediate. Request access to your PL and they will talk you through the process.

#### Timesheets

We are required to record our time working at the EBI in timesheets. A couple of clarifications:
- If you don’t have access to your cost centres (Only EBI time budget displays, or it doesn’t display the correct one(s)), ask Laura or Norman to follow up. If you don’t know which cost centres you should use for your timesheet, don’t hesitate to ask your PL.
- In order to fill your timesheet, you need to have a row per cost centre per day. If you do work for more than one cost centre in one day you will need to add row so don't be shy to click the "add row" button if necessary!

**Tips**: 

- Try to be short with the description of the work done (As you have to fit it in one line), 
- Balance your time so every week you have the percentages (According to the grants related to your job) right.
- Try to remember to submit your timesheet each week as a minimum, or strive for daily to ensure you're always recording your time accurately while it's fresh in your mind
- The hard deadline for submitting a timesheet is by the last day of each calendar month to ensure your supervisor has enough time to review and approve

### Google Docs and Drive

You have unlimited storage in Google Drive. Use it for storing all the documents that you create / all the information from the datasets that you wrangle and try to maintain it in a structured hierarchy. You will go through this on an onboard meeting.

Google Docs has most of the important documents that are used by the team on a regular basis. We don't expect you to know all of them the first day, so ask for a link to the document if you can't find it. Searching is useful for finding documents (if you know what you're looking for) but if there's anything you can't find do ask.

A good place to start is by checking out the `Brokering` folder (search is your friend) which is mainly where we store documents related to our ongoing wrangling tasks.

### E-mail

You should be able to access your email straight away via [webmail](https://webmail.ebi.ac.uk/) with the username and password given to you by your PL.

If you would also like to access your email using a desktop app you can follow the instructions [here](https://tsc.ebi.ac.uk/article/desktop/email/email-basics-0).

Your email should be checked throughout every working day. Part of your job as a wrangler consists of providing the data contributors all the help they might need. That being said, that doesn’t mean that you should leave everything you’re doing to answer an e-mail. Check the priorities and answer in an appropriate amount of time. 

#### Central HCA email lists

Check your [google groups](https://groups.google.com/a/data.humancellatlas.org/forum/#!myforums) and ask Enrique to add you if you are not a member of any of the following groups:

 - DCP Metadata Team
 - DCP Ingest Team
 - DCP Wrangler Team 
 - metadata-community 
 
 These are mailing lists that are used by the DCP to reach the metadata and wrangling teams, respectively. The DCP Wrangler Team email (`wrangler-team@data.humancellatlas.org`) is also used by data contributors for help during the submission process. 

The advantage of this system is that the history of the email address is all readily available and searchable on the relevant google group page: https://groups.google.com/a/data.humancellatlas.org

#### EBI/Sanger email lists

- [AIT email list](https://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/ait), you should add yourself to this one
- [List of EBI mailing lists](https://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo), feel free to join whichever you find interesting
- [List of Sanger mailing lists](https://lists.sanger.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo), feel free to join whichever you find interesting, popular ones to join are [for sale](https://lists.sanger.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/for-sale) and [general chat](https://lists.sanger.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/chat) also good for wranglers [Single Cell Genomics](https://lists.sanger.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/singlecellgenomics)

### VPN

- In order to be able to use most of the EBI services when you’re off-site, you will have to set up a VPN connection. You’ll have to set a 2-FOA (Factor Of Authentication) to be able to connect. A useful guide to do so can be found [here](https://tsc.ebi.ac.uk/article/linotp-tokens-setup-connecting). The easiest way is with a Google Authenticator compliant app, of your preference between the ones listed on the webpage.

### Github

The information here is general. You will go through all the specific details on the onboard meetings.

#### Setup

- Before beginning, you have to set up 2FOA security for your GitHub user. You can find the instructions on how to do so [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).
- Install [Git secrets](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/metadata-schema/issues/864)
- Install the [pre-commit](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/metadata-schema/issues/1032) python package that is to be used only [within the](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/metadata-schema) `metadata-schema` repo.
- It also makes things easier if you set up an SSH key. [GitHub's guide for adding an SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

#### General tips:

- Get comfortable creating GitHub issues to discuss about relevant topics.
- When creating a new branch to make changes, always pull the latest changes from develop before checking out. This will be the branch you will be mostly changing, and you want to keep up-to-date to it.

#### The Wrangler's most used repos
Repositories you will mainly use:
- [`HumanCellAtlas/metadata-schema`](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/metadata-schema): This is where the schema and most of the documentation for making changes to these schemas is stored. You should read through the documents, but to get you started, you should look at `commiters.md` and `structure.md`. This will shed some light for you on your first tasks.
- Ask to be added to the [metadata-updates](https://github.com/orgs/HumanCellAtlas/teams/metadata-updates) HCA GitHub team. Only members of this team will be allowed to commit to the metadata-schema repo.
- [`ebi-ait/hca-ebi-wrangler-central`](https://github.com/ebi-ait/hca-ebi-wrangler-central): Main repo for tracking all general wrangler tasks. Read the docs, especially the ones in the [SOPs](https://github.com/ebi-ait/hca-ebi-wrangler-central/tree/master/docs/SOPs) (Standard Operating Procedures) folder.

#### Other repos to be aware of

- [`HumanCellAtlas/dcp-community`](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/dcp-community): This is where a lot of the documentation for how the DCP works as a whole lives - most is now out of date. 
  - **Charters**: It would be useful to read through the [Metadata Schema](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/dcp-community/blob/master/charters/MetadataSchema/charter.md) and [Ingestion Service](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/dcp-community/blob/master/charters/IngestionService/charter.md) charters as Data Wrangling forms part of both of these. 

### Browser plug-ins

- [Zenhub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd): used by many of the teams in the DCP as way to implement the SCRUM and Agile methodologies within github. We have a combined [ingest board](https://github.com/ebi-ait/hca-ebi-wrangler-central/edit/master/docs/ebi-wrangler-onboarding.md#workspaces/ingest-dev-5cfe1cb26482e537cf35e8d1/board?repos=249765101,232300832,244611740,261790554,240563208,132741306,237019026,102351002) for tracking all work for the ingest team at EBI. You can play around with visibility to ensure the board is most relevant to your work.
- [Octotree](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octotree/bkhaagjahfmjljalopjnoealnfndnagc): Adds easier navigation of repos in github
- JSON viewer of your choice.

### Miscellanea

- Printers: If you install the correspondent apps (You can search for them as “Printer”, under the “Managed software centre” app), you will be able to use the Konica printers in both buildings. Using them to print personal photocopies has a little cost (1 pence) that is automatically subtracted from your salary.
- Fill in your details at the [`Bios and Photos – DCP`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gwrn2KgGGiEV37g0vhWnBrGLRvAPp-xXgq569R5WuPY/edit) document.
- Campus wifi: The mobile phone coverage on campus is quite patchy so you may wish to connect to the campus wifi. There is a Guest wifi (WGCGuest) as well as eduroam. To access eduroam you will need to first register. There are instructions via this link: https://tsc.ebi.ac.uk/article/wifi/eduroam
