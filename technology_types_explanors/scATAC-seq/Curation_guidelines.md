# How to curate scATAC-seq Data

### Overview

This guide is intended to hightlight the ***required metadata*** for scATAC-seq data. Optional metadata fields should be evaluated on an individual project basis given the experimental design and available metadata.

The ***required metadata*** includes:

(1) ontology terms: library construction method, sequencing method

(2) analysis file types that we require based on our review of scATAC-seq technology/publications (not evaluated during metadata schema validation)

### (1) Ontology terms

- See [technology type table](https://github.com/ebi-ait/hca-ebi-wrangler-central/blob/documentation_add_tech_type_table/technology_type_table.md)

### (2) Analysis file(s)
